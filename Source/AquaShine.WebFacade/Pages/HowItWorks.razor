        To time yourself you will need evidence that you have done the distance and time of completion, we recommend that you use Strava however if you have a smart watch that tracks your distance and records you such as Garmin upload your 10k to the results table and we can verify that it is official with no cheating allowed.
        You can download Strava here <MatAnchorLink href="https://www.strava.com/">https://www.strava.com/</MatAnchorLink>
        Share how you did and images on Facebook
